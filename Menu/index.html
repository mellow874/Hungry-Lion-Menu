        <div id="about-content">
          <p>Hungry Lion is a Quick Service Restaurant, founded with a simple yet ambitious vision: To bring joy to our employees, customers, and local communities through food, served with passion.</p>
          <p>We started as a small eatery in 1997, driven by our genuine desire to make people happy through food. Over the years, our dedication, commitment, and focus on quality have propelled us to become a household name in South Africa, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Angola and Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p>At the heart of our philosophy lies the belief that good food should never compromise on taste, quality, or nutritional value. We handpick the freshest ingredients, source them responsibly, and skilfully fry each piece of chicken to ensure an explosion of flavours with every bite.</p>

      <h1 class="heading">Our Story</h1>
      <div class="story-row">
        <div id="story-content">
          <p>Hungry Lion opened its first restaurant in South Africa in 1997 with a small store in Eikestad Mall in the iconic student town, Stellenbosch. This store proved so successful that four more stores were added in the same year, of which two were in Zambia, and one in the Eastern Cape.</p>
          <p>In 1998, we opened our first store in Namibia and in 1999, we branched out into Eswatini and Botswana. In 2010, we expanded into Angola, in 2024 into Lesotho and in 2025 we arrived in Zimbabwe.</p>
          <p>In 2025, we will proudly open the 500th Hungry Lion store and reach a milestone of 10,000 employees. And that’s just the beginning – we have big plans for expansion in the next few years!</p>
